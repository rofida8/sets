- Node.js (recommended version 14.x or later)
- npm (Node package manager)

You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rofida8/js-sets.git
    cd js-sets
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
